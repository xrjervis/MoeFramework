***GUIManager*** can open, close, show, hide UI panels dynamically at any time. The advantage is that you do not have to get these jobs fixed into the scene. And you may search and modify these panels more conveniently which increase reusability.

### Instruction
It contains the panel status to indicate which panel the game currently shows.
~~~
public enum PanelStatus {
	Loading,
	Home,
	Sale,
	Purchase,
	Bank,
	Dairy,
	Hospital,
	Produce,
	Achievement,
	IngredientStore,
	SnackStore,
	GiftStore,
	MaterialStore,
	Map
}
~~~

It contains a list to store all the UI panels in the scene. So you can check this list to get a UI panel instance.
~~~
public List<UIBase> m_UIList = new List<UIBase>();
~~~

In ShowUI method, we need to check if the UI prefab is null. Then we invoke InstantiateGameObject to show UI panel. Next, we need to remove "(Clone)" string of the panel's name because it is generated by unity automatically. And the ui instance must be added into the m_UIList.
~~~
public T ShowUI<T>() where T : UIBase {
	if (CheckCanvasRootIsNull())
		return null;

	GameObject loadGo = Utility.AssetRelate.ResourcesLoadCheckNull<GameObject>(GameManager.UI_PREFAB_PATH + typeof(T));
	if (loadGo == null)
		return null;


	GameObject ui = Utility.GameObjectRelate.InstantiateGameObject(m_CanvasRoot, loadGo);

	ui.name = ui.name.Replace("(Clone)", "").Trim();
	T t = ui.AddComponent<T>();
	t.Init(t.transform);
	m_UIList.Add(t);
	return t;
}
~~~

When you need to close a panel, you should remove it from the m_UIList and then destroy it.
~~~
public void CloseUI(UIBase ui) {
	m_UIList.Remove(ui);
	GameObject.Destroy(ui.gameObject);
    
}
