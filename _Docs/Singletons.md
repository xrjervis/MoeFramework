# Singletons

* * * * *

As this framwork is based on "Manager of Managers", thus each manager is an implementation of a singleton. Though you can implement by using static class, using singleton is somehow much more common and can adapt most of situations.

Be aware that you need to create an empty GameObject in the initial Unity scene and drag all the singleton managers on it.
