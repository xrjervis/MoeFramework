# Events

* * * * *
During the development, you may find it is a huge challenge to deal with all the button clicking events, timer trigger events and so forth. Therefore, constructing a message system is necessary, so you do not need to write logic codes inside the *OnButtonClick()* method or something like that, which keeps the codes clean and easier to maintain.
